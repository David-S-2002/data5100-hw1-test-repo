# data5100-hw1-test-repo

## Purpose
I created this repository for DATA 5100 Assignment 1 to experiment with the features of GitHub.

## Contents
The _main_ branch contains two Python files that print different versions of `"Hello, World!"`. There are also two other branches, each with its own file that prints `"Hello, World!"`. I used pull requests to merge those branches into _main_, and I reviewed the pull requests and left comments.
